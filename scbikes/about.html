        Santa Cruz Bicycles has been around since 1994. The first bike they created was the Tazmon, being the first pivot dual suspension bike. Having a dual-suspension mountain bike was not common in the 90s. The founder of Santa Cruz Bikes, Rob Roskopp saw the potential in this style of bike. Rob along with the entire time has worked tirelessly since 1994 in order to continue to build bikes that go further, faster, higher, for longer.
